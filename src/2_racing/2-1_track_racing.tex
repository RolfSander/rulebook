\section{Racing Categories}

\subsection{Male/Female}
Racing competition is held in two separate divisions: Male and Female. No heat of any race shall
 be composed of both male and female riders without the approval of the Racing Referee.

\subsection{Age Groups}
The following age groups are the minimum allowable by the IUF: 0-10 (20”), 0-13, 14-18, 19-29, 30-UP. For big 
conventions with many young riders 0-10 (20”), 0-12, 13-14, 15-18, 19-29, 30-UP is recommended. All age groups 
must be offered as male and female age group. Riders enter the required races (2.15) with their age group independent 
from the number of riders in each age group. Top riders from age group heats may qualify for the finals, or final heats, 
to race with the other fastest riders for that event. No race heat shall be composed of riders from more than one age 
group without approval of the Referee.
For all races except those listed in Section 2.16 (Minimum Racing Events) the age groups must be calculated with the 
following system: At a convention with less than 50 riders, three riders are enough to complete an age group; a 
convention with more than 50 riders, five riders are the minimum needed to complete an age group. For example: If 
there are four boys and five girls who are the same age at a big convention the boys will move to the next age group, 
and the girls would stay in their own age group.
