\chapter{Mountain Unicycling}

\section{Definition}
Mountain Unicycling (MUni) refers to off-road races over any type of terrain. Races can vary from a single heat race 
with all riders starting together, to a time-trial type of arrangement with riders going singly, at intervals. Mountains are not 
required. Terrain can be anything from dirt to paved areas, hills, ditches, curbs, rocks, sand, mud, or grass. Unless 
otherwise noted, there are no restrictions on wheel size, crank arm length, brakes or gearing
