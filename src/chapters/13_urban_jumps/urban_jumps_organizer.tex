\chapter{Event Organizer Rules}

\section{Practice Areas}

\oldrule{3.2}
The organizer should provide a place and equipment similar to those used for the official competition so the riders can practice before making their official attempts.
The equipment should be available during the whole length of the event, and even before if the organizer decides so.

For bigger events such as Unicon, national or continental events, the organizer must provide said equipment.
