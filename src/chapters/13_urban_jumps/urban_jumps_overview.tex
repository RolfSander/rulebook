\chapter{Overview}

\begin{framed}
New text, not from the 2014 rulebook is in \textbf{boldface}. Text that we suggest be deleted is in \textit{italic}. Since the text has been reorganized, the original 2014 sections are marked with a boxed reference, such as \oldrule{3.4}. Meta-text, intended for the rulebook editors is boxed.
