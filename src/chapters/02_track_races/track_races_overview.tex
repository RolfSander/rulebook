New text, not from the 2014 rulebook is in \textbf{boldface}. Text that we suggest be deleted is in \textit{italic}. Since the text has been reorganized, the original 2014 sections are marked with a boxed reference, such as \oldrule{3.4}. Meta-text, intended for the rulebook editors is boxed.

\section{Definition}

\oldrule{2.0}
Track \& Field encompasses a wide variety of unicycling disciplines that are done either on a racing track (similar to an athletics track) or in the ``Field''.
It includes all of the disciplines mentioned in this chapter, and all similar ones that are not described in the Rulebook.
Road Racing disciplines (part \ref{part:road_racing}) and Muni disciplines (part \ref{part:muni}) are among the disciplines that have their own parts in this Rulebook, and are not considered to be Track \& Field disciplines.
