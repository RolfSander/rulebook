\chapter{Overview}

\section{Definition}

\textbf{Track racing covers events done on an athletic track. These rules apply to the following races: 800m, 400m, 100m, one-foot, and wheel walk. Additional ``Track and Field'' events, such as the IUF Slalom can be found in Track: Other Chapter.}

\oldrule{2.0}
\textit{Track \& Field encompasses a wide variety of unicycling disciplines that are done either on a racing track (similar to an athletics track) or in the ``Field''.
It includes all of the disciplines mentioned in this chapter, and all similar ones that are not described in the Rulebook.
Road Racing disciplines (part \ref{part:road_racing}) and Muni disciplines (part \ref{part:muni}) are among the disciplines that have their own parts in this Rulebook, and are not considered to be Track \& Field disciplines.}
