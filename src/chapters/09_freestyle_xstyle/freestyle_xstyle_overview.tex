\section{Definition}

\textbf{In X-Style, starting groups of ten or fewer riders compete against each other, and the three best riders advance to the next round.  Riders are given a 1 or 2 minute run to show off their best skills.  In the final round, the three best riders become the winners of the competition.  Judges will be selected from other starting groups or from non-competing volunteers.}
