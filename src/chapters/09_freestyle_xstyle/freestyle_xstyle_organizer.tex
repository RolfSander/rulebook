\subsection{Run Length}
\oldrule{6.48.1}

The event director can choose the length of the runs, but it must be announced at least one month before the competition if it differs from the recommended format below.
Runs must be between 1 and 2 minutes 30 seconds.

\subsection{Starting Groups}
\oldrule{6.49}
There can be two distinct tournaments for junior (age 14 or younger) and senior (age 15 and older) riders.

The host can decide to order the riders by age and then split them into starting groups.
The host is also allowed to hand out awards to intermediate winners.
This can be motivating for younger riders.
