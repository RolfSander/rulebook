\chapter{Event Organizer Rules}

\section{Venue}

\subsection{Minimum Area \label{sec:flat-street_flatland-performing-area}}
A 11 x 14 meter area is required.
Judges will be situated along one of the 14 meter sides.
The audience may be as close to the boundaries as possible provided that they do not impede or obstruct the judges.

\subsection{Riding Surface}
Paved, outdoor areas are ideal for Flatland, so the riding surface must be of a similar texture and riding quality.
The optimum surface is concrete or asphalt, outside.
While being indoors offers shelter and climate control, most indoor surfaces are not suitable so this should be avoided.
Keep in mind that Flatland unicycles have tires that may mark, and metal pedals. Indoor concrete is probably not suitable.

\subsection{Postponement due to Weather}

In the Flatland competition the organizers should postpone the events in the case of rain or bad weather.
These competitions should be canceled if considered dangerous for the riders.
If postponed or moved to an indoor location the organizers must try to keep the allowances the same as outdoors competitions (metal pedals allowed for example).
If originally on the competition schedule, these canceled competitions should be rescheduled during the convention duration.
The event host should try to place events that may be influenced by weather conditions in the first days of the event, giving a larger period of time to reschedule it.

\subsection{Music}
In Flatland, a DJ plays music for the competition.
