\oldrule{6.2}
\textbf{This event has} a deadline for entry, which must be specified in the registration form.
If not specified in the registration form, the deadline is one month before the official convention start date.

\subsection{Riders Must Be Ready}

\oldrule{6.6}
Riders who are not ready at their scheduled performance time may or may not be allowed to perform after the last competitor in their age group.


\subsection{Competition Format}
\oldrule{6.18}
Riders perform a one minute preliminary run and the top riders continue on to tournament-style Battle finals.

\subsection{Preliminary Round}
\oldrule{6.19}
The preliminary round will last one minute.
No tricks after time is called will be counted.
If a rider is in a combo when their time ends, they may end the trick they are performing but are not allowed to go into another trick.

\subsection{Battle-style Overview}
\oldrule{6.20}
In a Flatland battle, riders compete head-to-head in groups of two, taking turns performing lines of tricks.
The winner of each battle is determined immediately following the battle by the judges.
The winner continues to the next battle and the loser is eliminated.

\subsection{Number Of Competitors Entering Battles}
\oldrule{6.21}
The final battles will consist of up to the 16 highest-scoring riders.
To decide on the number, the judges will vote.
A simple majority is needed to decide whether 4, 8, or 16 riders will advance.
However, a number other than 4, 8, or 16 may be chosen if the judges unanimously agree that a different number would be more conducive to the goal of producing the most exciting battles for riders and spectators.
In this case, byes would be used for this group to fit the next largest bracket (for example, 11 riders would use the 16 rider bracket, and the top 5 riders would get a bye for the first round of battles).

\subsubsection{Battle Assignments:}
\oldrule{6.21.1}
Battles will proceed according to the following brackets, depending on whether 4, 8, or 16 riders advance. Due to time constraints the losers bracket may be disregarded at the host's discretion. At Unicon, the full bracket must be used in the Jr. Expert and Expert competitions.

\subsection{Battle Finals}

Each battle will last two minutes, except for the final 4 battles.
These semifinal and final battles will last three minutes, unless another duration between 2 and 4 minutes is agreed upon by both riders.
There will be two countdown timers, one for each rider, and each of these will be set to one minute.
Each timer will be started and stopped when each rider starts and stops.
Riders should aim to complete each turn in about 15 seconds.
No tricks after time is called will be counted.
If a rider is in a combo when their time ends, they may end the trick they are performing but are not allowed to go into another trick.
After one rider's time runs out, the other rider will ride for the rest of their time and then both will proceed to Last Trick.
