\chapter{Judges and Officials Rules}

\section{Flatland Director}

The Flatland Director is the head organizer and administrator of the flatland competition.
With the Convention Host, the Flatland Director determines the system used to run the event.
The Flatland Director is responsible for the logistics and equipment for all flatland events.
With the Chief Judge, the Flatland Director is in charge of keeping events running on schedule, and answers all questions not pertaining to rules and judging.
The Flatland Director is the highest authority on everything to do with the flatland competition, except for decisions on rules and results.

\section{Chief Judge}

The Chief Judge is the head flatland official, whose primary job is to make sure the rules are followed.
The Chief Judge oversees the competition, deals with protests, and answers all rules and judging questions.
The Chief Judge is responsible for seeing that all judges are trained and ready.
The Chief Judge is also responsible for the accuracy of all judging point tabulations and calculations.

The Chief Judge will remember to consider language barriers, and that riders may be engaged in convention work to slow them down.
A rider may not perform before a different set of judges than those that judged the rest of their age group.

An interruption of judging can result from material damage, injury or sudden illness of a competitor, or interference with a competitor by a person or object.
If this happens, the Chief Judge determines the amount of time left and whether any damage may be the fault of the competitor.
Re-admittance into competition must happen within the regulatory competition time.
If a routine is continued and the competitor was not at fault for the interruption, all devaluations coming forth from the interruption will be withdrawn.

\section{Judges}

\subsection{Judging Panel}

There must always be an odd number of judges to prevent ties. 

\subsection{Selecting Judges}
A person should not judge an event if he or she is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A parent, child or sibling of a rider competing in the event.
\item An individual or team coach, manager, trainer, colleague who is member of the same club specified in the registration form, colleague's family etc. of a rider competing in the event.
\item More than one judge from the same family judging the same event at the same time.
\end{enumerate}

If the judging pool is too limited by the above criteria, restrictions can be eliminated starting from the bottom of the list and working upward as necessary only until enough judges are available.
If there are some candidates who have the same level of restrictions and judging score, their agreement about publishing the results need to be considered.
The eliminations must be agreed upon by the Chief Judge and Flatland Director, or next-highest ranking street official if the Chief Judge and Flatland Director are the same person.

\subsection{Judging Panel May Not Change}

The individual members of the judging panel must remain the same for an entire category; for example one judge may not be replaced by another except between categories.
In the event of a medical or other emergency, this rule can be waived by the Chief Judge.

\subsubsection{Rating Judge Performance}
Judges are rated by comparing their scores to those of other judges at previous competitions.
Characteristics of Judging Weaknesses:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Excessive Ties:}
A judge should be able to differentiate between competitors.
Though tying is most definitely acceptable, excessive use of tying defeats the purpose of judging.
\item \textbf{Group Bias:}
If a judge places members of a certain group or nation significantly different from the other judges.
This includes a judge placing members significantly higher or significantly lower (a judge may be harsher on his or her own group members) than the other judges.
\item\textbf{Inconsistent Placing:}
If a judge places a large number of riders significantly different from the average of the other judges.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training}
The judges workshop is set by the Flatland Director or Chief Judge.
Either the Flatland Director or the Chief Judge run the workshop.
The workshop must be help before the competition.
Judges should have read the rules prior to the start of the workshop.
The workshop will include a practice session.
Each judge will read the rules, attend the workshop,  agree to follow the rules and agree to their potential removal from the list of available judges if they show excessive judges weaknesses, as determined by the Chief Judge.

\section{Flatland Judging and Scoring \label{sec:flat\itemstreet_flatland\itemjudging\itemscoring}}

\subsection{Judging Criteria}

Preliminary rounds and battles are judged using the following criteria.
The rider's total score is out of 40 points:

\textbf{Difficulty} (0 to 10 points):

Score is given for technical difficulty of the tricks and combos landed during the battle/preliminary.

\textbf{Consistency} (0 to 10 points):

Score is given for number of landed trick/combos on total of number of tricks/combos attempted during the battle/preliminary.

\textbf{Variety} (0 to 10 points):

Score is given for variation in the types of tricks done during the battle/preliminary.

\textbf{Flow} (0 to 5 points):

Score is given for cleanliness and style of rider during the battle/preliminary.

\textbf{Last Trick} (0 to 5 points):

Score is given for technical difficulty, novelty, creativity, and flow.

There are 2 attempts in preliminary. 
There are 3 attempts for each rider in battles. Rider will take turn attempting their last trick. The rider is not obligated to use all attempts or to try the same trick every attempt.
Only the last attempt will be scored.
Other failed attempts do not subtract from the score. The rider who started the battle starts the last trick.

Guide on how to score points for last trick:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0 point: nothing landed / unworthy trick
\item 1 point: passable trick / almost landed great or insane trick
\item 2 point: okay trick / almost landed very insane trick
\item 3 points: good trick
\item 4 points: great trick
\item 5 points: insane trick
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preliminary Round}
At the end of every preliminary run, the judges add up a rider's score.
Once all preliminary runs are over, the judges add up points for each rider and then rank the riders accordingly to their total number of points.


\subsection{Battle Advancement \label{subsec:flat\itemstreet_flatland\itemjudging\itemscoring_battle}}
Judges must determine a winner individually.
The Chief Judge collects the results from each judge and then the winner is announced.

\subsection{Sportsmanship}
If a rider distracts or delays other riders, judges, commentator, or shows unsportsmanlike conduct, the judges may choose to warn or eliminate that rider.

\subsection{Finals/Semi-Finals}
The winner and loser of the final battle round take first and second place in the competition. The losers of the semi-final battle round compete in a final battle for third place.

\subsection{Preliminary Round Scoring}
In the preliminary round, raw scores from the judges are added to determine the placing of the riders.
For each rider, the highest and lowest scores are removed. %comment-2016 still?
If there are two riders with equal points in places 1-16, the rider with most points in ``last trick'' get an additional fraction of a point to break the tie.
The additional fraction of a point cannot result in that rider receiving a higher score than any previously higher-scoring rider.
If the riders' ``last trick'' scores are equal, they must show a last line and the judges must vote for the best, like later in battles.

\subsection{Battle Scoring}
For battles, judges must decide on a single rider to vote on, they cannot tie the riders.
If a judge feels both riders performed equally based on their judging criteria, they must look at the ``last trick.''
The rider with the best score for ``last trick'' will be the winner.

Judges are not required to write down scores for each category during battles.
