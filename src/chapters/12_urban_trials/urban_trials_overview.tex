\section{Definition}

\oldrule{7.1}
The object of unicycle trials is to ride over obstacles. 
A unicycle trials competition takes place on a ``course'' containing different obstacles called ``sections''. 
Each section is worth one point, and courses typically contain 15 â€“ 40 or more sections.

Riders earn points by successfully riding (``cleaning'') each section from start to finish. 
The objective is to earn as many points as possible by cleaning as many sections as possible.

At the end of a specified time period, the rider with the highest overall number of points (who has cleaned the most number of sections) is the winner.
