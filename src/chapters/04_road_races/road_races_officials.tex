\chapter{Judges and Officials Rules}

\begin{framed}
We think that the officials for each event need to be specified in event chapter, not in chapter 1. For this event, we have taken the approach that the rules will specify the scope of responsibility for the official.

\section{Racing Officials}

\begin{framed}
Here is the original text that was reworded in the following two sections. This section should be removed after the rewording is approved.
\end{framed}

\oldrule{1.27}

\textbf{Referee:} The Head racing official.
Makes all final decisions regarding race competitions.
Handles protests.
Makes sure racing areas and officials are trained and ready.

The Referee should be someone very experienced in all aspects of unicycle racing, and must above all be objective and favor neither local, nor outside riders.
There can be separate Referees for different venues, or different categories of racing.

\section{Race Director}

\begin{framed}
This and the next section were based on text from Chapter 1, reworded to make it specific to road racing.
\end{framed}

\textbf{The Race Director is the head organizer and administrator of road race
events.  With the Convention Host, the Race Director determines the course,
obtains permis, interfaces with the community, and determines the system
used to run the event.  The Race Director is responsible for the logistics,
equipment for all road racing events.  With the Referee, the
Race Director is in charge of keeping events running on schedule, and
answers all questions not pertaining to rules and judging.  The Race
Director is the highest authority on everything to do with the road race
events, except for decisions on rules and results.}

\section{Referee}

\textbf{The Referee is the head racing official, whose primary job is to make sure
the competitors follow the rules.  The Referee makes all final decisions
regarding rule infractions. The Referee is responsible for resolving

\subsection{Specific Consequences}

\oldrule{3.3}
\textit{The Referee has final say on whether a rider's safety equipment is sufficient. 
The Starter will remove from the starting line-up any riders not properly equipped to race, including riders with dangerously loose shoelaces.}

\oldrule{3.11.2}
[Regarding forced dismounts] The Referee can override this rule if intentional interference is observed.

\oldrule{3.11.3}
A rider who is forced to dismount due to interference by another rider may file a protest immediately at the end of the race.
Riders who intentionally interfere with other riders may receive from the Referee a warning, a loss of placement (given the next lower finishing place), disqualification from that race/event, or suspension from all races.
