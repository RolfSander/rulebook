\chapter{2013 Freestyle \& Standard Skill \label{chap:freestyle} Overview}

\section{The Difference Between These Events}
In Standard Skill, riders demonstrate pure skill and mastery on a standard unicycle, by performing up to 18 skills they have pre-selected.
Standard Skill judging is based on the point value of the skills and quality of their execution, not the `show.'
