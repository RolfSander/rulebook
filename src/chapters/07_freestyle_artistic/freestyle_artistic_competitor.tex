\subsection{Judging Method}

\subsubsection{Judging Method: Individual}
\oldrule{6.13.6}

Read the Artistic Freestyle Judging section to learn more.

\subsubsection{Judging Method: Pair}
\oldrule{6.14.6}
Same as Individual Freestyle, 50\% for Technical, and 50\% for Presentation.
In Pairs, there is extra emphasis on teamwork; two person skills, etc.
(see Judging Criteria).

\subsubsection{Judging Method: Group}
\oldrule{6.15.8}
Same as Individual Freestyle, but with additional emphasis on teamwork and multiple person skills, such as formation riding.
Extra consideration will be given to account for widely different group sizes, relative skill levels, and relative ages of riders.


\subsection{Music and Costume}
\oldrule{6.13.4}
All are judged, and must be considered in the performance.

\oldrule{6.14.4}
\textit{Same as Individual Freestyle.}

\oldrule{6.15.6}
\textit{Same as Individual Freestyle.}

\subsection{Props and Decorations \label{subsec:freestyle_freestyle-rules_individual-freestyle-overview_props-and-decorations}}
\oldrule{6.13.5}

\textbf{Props} are all items which are used by the rider in his/her performance and require a technical handling by the rider (for example typical objects like clubs, ribbons, hoop, etc.). 
These items can be used to do a unicycling trick, like rope skipping with the unicycle.
However, they can also be employed to show a non-unicycling skill which supports and enhances the choreography, like the elaborate use of a hat.
Props have to be presented by the rider.
It is not mandatory to include props in the performance.
If none are used, the score will not be lower. 

\textbf{Decoration:} In contrast to props, decoration is used to present the rider or clarify the theme of the performance.
Decoration does not require a technical handling by the rider.
For example other persons in costumes and background images.
Decoration is no personal contribution of the rider and therefore effects of the Decorations should not be judged.
On the contrary, Decorations can also be judged negatively if it distracts from the riderâ€™s performance.
For Junior Expert and Expert categories at Unicon, it is forbidden to use decorations (including people) that are too large, which the competitor cannot carry and/or put on by oneself. 

For Props and Decoration neither fire nor sharp objects (such as juggling knives) are allowed.

\oldrule{6.14.5}
\textit{Same as Individual Freestyle.}

\oldrule{6.15.7}
\textit{Same as Individual Freestyle.}

\subsection{Group Freestyle Restrictions}
\oldrule{6.15}
Group Freestyle is divided in Large Groups and Small Groups 
Each rider may enter each category (Small Group, Large Group) only once. For example: a rider can be in one small group routine and one large group routine but not two small group routines (without permission).

A rider may appear in a second Group Freestyle performance (Small Group, Large Group) with permission of the Chief Judge, to replace a rider due to illness, injury or other mishap. 

\subsubsection{Small Group}
\oldrule{6.15.1}
Minimum of three riders, maximum of eight.

\subsubsection{Large Group}
\oldrule{6.15.2}
Minimum of nine riders, no maximum number of riders.

\subsection{Riders Must Be Ready}
\oldrule{6.2.1}
Riders who are not ready at their scheduled performance time may or may not be allowed to perform after the last competitor in their age group or category.
The Chief Judge will remember to consider language barriers, and that riders may be engaged in convention work to slow them down.
Except for Standard Skill, a rider may not perform before a different set of judges than those that judged the rest of their age group or category.

\section{Rider's No-Signal Option}

\oldrule{6.21.1}
A rider may have a well-planned routine to music that he or she knows is under the time limit, and does not wish for the acoustic signals to detract from his or her performance.
When riders sign up with the Rider Liaison they can request ``No acoustic signals.'' This will eliminate the `Start' signal, and the 30-second warning.
The Timer will still keep the time, and if the rider exceeds the time limit, the Timer will make the `double acoustic signal' to indicate the rider has run overtime.

\subsection{Start Of Performance}
\oldrule{6.19.1}
The judging, the stopwatch, and the `performance' all start at the same time.
The Timer starts the watch at the beginning of the music, or at a signal from competitors, whichever comes first.
The signal can be a nod, wave, bow, verbal cue (``Start!'') or any clearly understandable means.
An acoustic signal (such as a whistle) will indicate that the timing and judging have started.
Any non-unicycling activities such as dancing, posing, acrobatics, etc., must be included within the time limit of the routine to be judged.
In all Freestyle routines, an acoustic signal will indicate when there are 30 seconds left.
In all artistic events, two acoustic signals or a different signal will indicate the end of the riding time and end of the judging.

\subsection{End Of Performance}
\oldrule{6.20}
The performance ends at a signal from the rider, such as a bow or ``Thank you,'' an obvious endpoint, or at the end of the time limit.
Nothing that occurs after the time limit may affect judging scores.

\oldrule{6.20.1}
An acoustic signal will indicate the end of the time limit.
Any figures or performing that are done after the end of the time limit will not be judged Performing past the time limit will reduce the rider's score.
All time limits are maximums.
Riders need not fill the entire time, but a routine that is very short may suffer in points over a routine with more content.
However, a routine that is boring, repetitive or `padded' may lose points for being too long.
The rider must decide what makes the best performance.

\subsection{Clean-Up}
\oldrule{6.22}
In unicycling, a clean, dry riding surface is essential.
After a performance, the riding area must be left the way it was before the performance.
Riders and their helpers must clear all props, unicycles, and debris from the performing area within two minutes.
The next rider may also be setting up during this time.

\subsection{Messy Performing Area}
\oldrule{6.23}
Riders who are thinking of using messy props in their performances must carefully consider the above rule.
Popping balloons, dirt or powder, confetti, water, pies, etc.
may take longer than two minutes to remove.
Special permission must be received from the Chief Judge or Artistic Director before any such props are used.
Competitors who make messes they are unable to remove may be disqualified from the event.
