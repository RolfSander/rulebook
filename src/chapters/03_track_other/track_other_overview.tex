\chapter{Overview}

\begin{framed}
This chapter does not follow the format of the other chapters, so we should think about whether it is presented the best way.  Essentially, it is a list of more or less informal events traditionally associated with track. Some options are (1) they could go in an appendix or addendum to the track chapter, or (2) they could be formalized more, so they have the format of the other chapters.  This needs to be discussed.
